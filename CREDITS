                     Colm Programming Language -- CREDITS
                     ====================================

The Colm Programming Language was designed and developed by by myself,
Adrian Thurston <thurston@colm.net> as an implementation of the ideas developed
in my PhD thesis. Several others have helped, including Peter Reijnders and
Wictor Lund. Please also see github contributors list.
